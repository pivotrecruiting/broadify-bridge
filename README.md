<h1 align="center">Electron + Vite + React + Typescript + TailWindCSS + ShadCN</h1>

This is an **Electron** template using **Vite, React, Typescript, TailWindCSS and ShadCN**. It includes hot reloading, IPC type-safety and general security.

## Project Setup

#### It works on Windows but I haven't tested it on neither Linux nor Mac

1. Clone the repository
1. Change the **`.env.example`** file to **`.env`**
1. Run **`npm install`** inside the cloned repository
1. Run the app to see if everything is working.

## For development

1. **Starting the application** - Run **`npm run dev`** - This starts the application as well as a local server on port **`3524`**
1. **Changing the port** - You can change the server port at the **`.env`** file.

## For production

1. To create a production for Windows run **`npm run dist:win`**
1. To create a production for Linux run **`npm run dist:linux`**
1. To create a production for Mac run **`npm run dist:mac`**
